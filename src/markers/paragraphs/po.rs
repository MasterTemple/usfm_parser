```usfm
\c 1
\po
\v 1 From Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus and an apostle chosen and called by God to
preach his Good News.
\p
\v 2 The Good News was promised long ago by God through his prophets, as written in the
Holy Scriptures.
\v 3 It is about his Son, our Lord Jesus Christ: as to his humanity, he was born a
descendant of David;
\v 4 as to his divine holiness, he was shown with great power to be the Son of God by being
raised from death.
\v 5 Through him God gave me the privilege of being an apostle for the sake of Christ,
in order to lead people of all nations to believe and obey.
\v 6 This also includes you who are in Rome, whom God has called to belong to Jesus Christ.
\po
\v 7 And so I write to all of you in Rome whom God loves and has called to be his own
people:
\po May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace.
