\pm
\v 28 The Holy Spirit has shown us that we should not place any extra burden on you.
\v 29 But you should not eat anything offered to idols. You should not eat any meat that
still has the blood in it or any meat of any animal that has been strangled. You must also
not commit any terrible sexual sins. If you follow these instructions, you will do well.
\pmc We send our best wishes.
